                <p>This was my first project. It utilizes the Congress gem with data from the Sunglight Foundation. Users can see recent activity in both houses of Congress, as well as see who their representatives are. This was built using HTML, CSS, and Ruby on Rails.</p>

              <img src="img/vibe.png" alt="Vibe screenshot">
              <p>This was the second project and was a group project. For this project I worked on the front-end. I was primarily reponsible for the jQuery animations. Enter in a city and you will see a set of images from different social media sites animate across the page. This will give you the "vibe" in that location.</p>
