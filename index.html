          <p>Welcome to my site.</p>

          <p>I recently completed the twelve week long Web Development Immersive Course with General Assembly. I am a full-stack developer, with knowledge of Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML, CSS, as well as frameworks such as jQuery. Prior to embarking on this journey, I worked in software QA in games and with mobile applications. I also have experience in project management. I'm currently looking for an entry-level position that will allow me to apply what I've learned, and to learn even more and grow as a developer. Keep scrolling to see some projects I've worked on, some of my previous experiences, and my contact information.</p>
