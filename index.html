          <p>Welcome to my site.</p>

          <p>I recently completed the twelve week long Web Development Immersive Course with General Assembly. I am a full-stack developer, with knowledge of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
              <li>Javascript</li>
              <li>HTML</li>
              <li>CSS</li>
              <li>jQuery and other frameworks</li>
              <li>Java</li>
              <li>C++</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Prior to embarking on this journey, I worked in software QA in games and with mobile applications. I also have experience in project management. I'm currently looking for an entry-level position that will allow me to apply what I've learned, and to learn even more and grow as a developer. Keep scrolling to see some projects I've worked on, some of my previous experiences, and my contact information.</p>

            <img src="img/govwatch.png" alt="GovWatch screenshot">
            <p>This was my first project. It utilizes the Congress gem with data from the Sunglight Foundation. Users can see recent activity in both houses of Congress, as well as see who their representatives are. This was built using HTML, CSS, and Ruby on Rails.</p>

            <h3>Vibe</h3>
            <img src="img/vibe.png" alt="Vibe screenshot">
            <p>This was the second project and was a group project. For this project I worked on the front-end. I was primarily reponsible for the jQuery animations. Enter in a city and you will see a set of images from different social media sites animate across the page. This will give you the "vibe" in that location.</p>

            <img src="img/petsitter2.png" alt="PetSitter screenshot">
            <p>The idea for my third project came when taking a weekend trip. I needed someone to watch the cat while away. So I decided to make the PetSitter app. Sitters can see what needs to be done and when. Pet guardians receive a message letting them know when tasks have been completed and their pet is being taken care of. This app uses Ruby on Rails in the back-end and jQuery mobile on the front-end. This app isn't yet finished. The screenshots are concepts, I'm still finalizing the UI.</p>
            <p>URL: Still under construction.</p>
